Turtle WoW GBank fix for SuperWoW
===

** This addon should't be neccesary anymore since 1.18.0 **

This is not quite an addon, it goes in your Data Folder.

Fixes:
* An error message that occurs when being near the guild bank npc without the guild bank open.  
* The interaction of items with charges when trying to deposit.  

---
* Made by and for Weird Vibes of Turtle WoW
